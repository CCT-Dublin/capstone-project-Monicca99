    "This project analyzes fuel prices in Brazil from 2004 to 2024, focusing on regional variations and seasonal trends. The data, provided by ANP, includes key metrics like average resale prices and station coverage. The study identifies significant price disparities across regions, seasonal price peaks, and provides predictive models for future price trends. Strategic recommendations are made to optimize logistics and prepare for demand fluctuations.\n",
