    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the strategic implications of fuel prices in Brazil using data from the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP). Fuel price fluctuations directly impact transportation, logistics, and consumer costs, making it essential for policymakers and businesses to understand their trends and regional disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to develop predictive machine learning models capable of forecasting average fuel prices based on historical trends and contextual variables such as region, fuel type, and economic indicators. This analysis supports strategic decision-making, enabling stakeholders to anticipate price changes and design better pricing policies or subsidy programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying data science techniques, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and supervised learning algorithms, this project aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify regional and temporal patterns in fuel prices;\n",
    "- Evaluate and compare machine learning models for price prediction;\n",
    "- Provide data-driven insights and strategic recommendations;\n",
    "- Highlight potential challenges in the Brazilian fuel market.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of the Strategic Thinking module at CCT College Dublin and integrates technical, business, and policy-driven perspectives."

    "# Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project was sourced from the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP). It contains detailed monthly records of fuel prices across all Brazilian states and regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Key Attributes:\n",
    "- `start_date`: The beginning date of the fuel price collection period.\n",
    "- `region`: The geographic region in Brazil (e.g., North, South, Southeast).\n",
    "- `state`: The specific state where prices were recorded.\n",
    "- `fuel`: Type of fuel (e.g., Gasoline, Diesel, Ethanol, GNV).\n",
    "- `unit`: Measurement unit (e.g., R$/liter, R$/kg, R$/m³).\n",
    "- `avg_price`: Average resale price of the fuel.\n",
    "- `sd_price`: Standard deviation of resale prices.\n",
    "- `min_price`, `max_price`: Minimum and maximum prices recorded.\n",
    "- `avg_price_margin`: Difference between resale and distribution price.\n",
    "- `coef_price`: Coefficient of variation for resale prices.\n",
    "- `dist_avg_price`: Average distribution price to fuel stations.\n",
    "- `dist_sd_price`, `dist_min_price`, `dist_max_price`: Stats on distribution prices.\n",
    "- `coef_dist`: Coefficient of variation for distribution prices.\n",
    "- `month`, `year`, `month-year`: Extracted temporal features for trend analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Dataset Summary:\n",
    "- **Time Span:** Monthly data from multiple years (to be confirmed by `.min()` and `.max()`).\n",
    "- **Observations:** Over 20,000 rows covering all regions and main fuel types.\n",
    "- **Granularity:** Regional and state-level resolution.\n",
    "- **Source:** [ANP Open Data](https://www.gov.br/anp/pt-br)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset enables both temporal and spatial analysis of fuel price behavior, as well as predictive modeling through machine learning techniques.\n"
